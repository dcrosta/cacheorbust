# About

CacheOrBust is a special-purpose cache for HTTP requests. Requests for pages
which are not yet cached immediately return an empty response, and enqueue a
request to be made to the upstream HTTP server in the background. When the
background request completes, the response body is cached.

Requests to CacheOrBust are made using a modified subset of the memcached
protocol. Most memcached client libraries should work with CacheOrBust with
little or no modification.

To request a page from the cache, issue a memcached `get` command with two
keys: a unique key to identify the page in the cache, and the full URL of the
resource to be cached. It may be necessary to configure your memcached client
library with a larger maximum key length than normal, as some URLs can be quite
long.


# Running the Service

CacheOrBust is built as a "pluggable server" for Kyoto Tycoon. The full path
to ktcacheorbust.so should be given to the `-plsv` option to `ktserver`:

    $ ktserver -plsv /usr/local/lib/ktcacheorbust-1.0.so

CacheOrBust understands several options which can be set using the `-plex`
option to `ktserver`:

* `host`: sets the hostname for the listening socket [default: localhost]
* `port`: sets the port number for the listening socket [default: 6080]
* `server_threads`: number of threads to handle memcached requests [default: 16]
* `fetcher_threads`: number of threads to handle background HTTP fetches [default: 16]
* `ttl`: number of seconds for which cached results are served before re-fetching
  from the upstream server [default: 3600]
* `keepalive`: if "true", background HTTP requests will use HTTP Keep-Alive
   requests when requesting multiple URLs from the same host [default: false]

A good starting point is:

    $ ktserver -plsv /usr/local/lib/ktcacheorbust-1.0.so -plex "port=1234#ttl=43200"


# Using the Service

CacheOrBust uses a variant and subset of the text-based memcached protocol.
The memcached protocol was chosen for its low overhead and suitability for
use in performance-sensitive applications (as opposed to HTTP).

CacheOrBust supports `get`, `stats`, `flush_all` commands from the memcached
protocol. The `stats` and `flush_all` commands are supported exactly as
described in [the memcached protocol
documentation](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt);
`get` works differently by necessity. All other commands are not supported.

The `get` command accepts 2 or 3 arguments:

    get key url [ttl]

The `key` is a unique key within the cache. If a value for the key already
exists, then the cached contents of the `url` is immediately returned; if
not, the `url` is fetched in the background, and CacheOrBust returns an
empty response (no `VALUE` line in the memcached protocol) immediately.
Subsequent requests for the `key` made after the `url` is fetched return the
contents of the `url`.

Cached contents are stored for `ttl` seconds. `ttl` defaults to the value
specified at server startup, or 3,600 seconds (1 hour) if no default is
specified.


# Install

CacheOrBust uses autotools, which can be installed through your
distribution's package manager, and depends on libraries and headers from
Kyoto Cabinet and Kyoto Tycoon, which can be found at http://fallabs.com/.

With dependencies installed, you can configure the build environment with:

    $ autoreconf
    $ ./configure

And then build the CacheOrBust shared object library with:

    $ make
    $ [sudo] make install
